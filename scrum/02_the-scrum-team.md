# The Scrum Team

    'The Scrum Team has proven itself to be increasingly effective for all the earlier stated uses, and any complex work.'

<hr>

The Scrum Team consists of:
- Product Owner;
- The Development Team and
- Scrum Master.

Scrum teams are self-organizing and cross-functional.

The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity and productivity.


<b>Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally,</b> maximizing opportunities for feedback. Incremental deliveries of "Done" product ensure a potentially useful version of working product is always available.

### The Product Owner

The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team. How this is done may vary.

The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog*. 

    * -> // A product backlog is a list of the new features, changes to existing features, bug fixes, infrastructure changes or other activities that a team may deliver in order to achieve a specific outcome. The product backlog is the single authoritative source for things that a team works on. //


Product Backlog management includes:

- Cleary expressing Product Backlog items;
- Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
- Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next;
- Ensuring the Development Team understand items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.

The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However, the Product Owner remains accountable.

For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. The Product Ownerâ€™s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. No one can force the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements.

### The Development Team

Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint.

Fewer than three Development Team members decrease interaction and results in smaller productivity gains. Smaller Development Teams may encounter skill constraints during the Sprint, causing the Development Team to be unable to deliver a potentially releasable Increment. Having more than nine members requires too much coordination. Large Development Teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process to be useful. The Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included in this count unless they are also executing the work of the Sprint Backlog.

### The Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team.


The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules and values.

<b>The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner</b> in several ways, including:

- Ensuring that goals, scope and product domain are understood by everyone on the Scrum Team as well as possible;
- Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management;
- Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;

<b>The Scrum Master serves the Development Team</b> in several ways, including:

- Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality;
- Helping the Development Team to create high-value products;
- Removing impediments to the Development Team's progress;
- Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.

<b>The Scrum Master serves the Organization</b> in several ways, including:

- Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;
- Planning Scrum implementations within the organization;
- Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development;
- Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team.
