# Scrum Events

Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.

<b>All events are time-boxed events, such that every event has a maximum duration.</b>

### The Sprint

<b>The heart of Scrum is a Sprint</b>, a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", useable and potentially releasable product increment is created. Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts imeediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

Sprint contains and consist of:

- The Sprint Planning;
- Daily Scrums;
- The Development Work;
- The Sprint Review;
- Sprint Retrospective.

Each Sprint may be considered a project with no more than a one-month horizon. Like projects, Sprints are used to accomplish something. Each Sprint has a goal of what is to be built, a design and flexible plan that will guide building it, the work, and the resultant product increment.

#### Cancelling a Sprint

A Sprint can be cancelled before the Sprint time-box is over. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint, although he or she may do so under influence from the stakeholders, the Development Team, or the Scrum Master.

A Sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. This might occur if the company changes direction or if market or technology conditions change. In general, a Sprint should be cancelled if it no longer makes sense given the circumstances. But, due to the short duration of Sprints, cancellation rarely makes sense.

#### Sprint Planning

The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint.

For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose.

The Scrum Master teaches the Scrum Team to keep it within the time-box.

Sprint Planning answers the following:

- What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?

- How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

#### Topic one in Sprint Planning:

    What can be done at this Sprint?

The Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint. The Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal. The entire Scrum Team collaborates on understanding the work of the Sprint.

The input to this meeting is the Product Backlog, the latest product Increment, projected capacity of the Development Team during the Sprint, and past performance of the Development Team. 

The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the Development Team. Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint.

During Sprint Planning, the Scrum Team also crafts a Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met whithin the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog, and it provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.

#### Topic two in Sprint Planning:

    How will the chosen work get done?

Having set the Sprint Goal and selected the Product Backlog items for the Sprint, the Development Team decides how it will build this functionality into a "Done" product Increment during the Sprint. The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog.

The Development Team usually starts by designing the system and the work needed to convert the Product Backlog into a working product Increment.

By the end of the Sprint Planning, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner and Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment.

#### The Sprint Goal

The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog.

It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint.

As the Development Team works, it keeps the Sprint Goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint Goal, it implements functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.
