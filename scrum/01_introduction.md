# What is Scrum?

Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering and sustaining complex products. 

Scrum is:
- Lightweight
- Simple to understand
- Difficult to master

Scrum is not a process, technique or definitive method. Rather, it is a framework withing which you can employ various processes and techniques.

Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.
